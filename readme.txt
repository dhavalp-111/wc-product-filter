Create one product filter for WooCommerce using Ajax with the following options:

* Filter by categories ( Allow user to select multiple )

* Filter by variations ( Size, Color, etc )

* Filter by on-sale

* Filter by price range

* Live Search products

* Filter must work with the same layout as WooCommerce products. Also, it will display on shop and product category page, automatically on install.
